# Details about SIG Data Science sub-projects

## Operate First Data Science Community

This subproject is responsible for organizing, hosting, promoting and growing the Operate First Data Science Community and its associated meetup.

The  Operate First Data Science Community aims to embrace the multidisciplinary nature of the current state of AI operations and cloud infrastructure by discussing technical topics relevant to data scientists, software developers, DevOps professionals, statisticians, and the intersection of their work, all in an open and collaborative public platform.

## AI4CI - AI Supported Continuous Integration

This subproject is responsible for developing and maintaining a collection of AIOps tools involving open operations data sources. It is a collection of several initiatives such as data collection from open data platforms, generating and visualizing metrics and KPIs to evaluate the CI data sources, building AI/ML services to support operations, and creating a reproducible workflow around these processes. By making the initial tools and relevant data openly accessible, AI4CI aims to foster collaboration and contributions between data scientists and DevOps engineers.
